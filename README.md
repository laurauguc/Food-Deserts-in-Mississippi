# Food-Deserts-in-Mississippi

Test.


I completed this project for my GIS and Spatial Analysis work. I analyzed the association between food deserts and health outcomes, diabetes and obesity. I defined food deserts as census tracts completely outside a particular radius from a produce outlet. I then constructed a county-level measure of food deserts and ran a spatially weighted regression of health outcomes on food deserts, controlling for age and household income. I then conducted sensitivity analysis and interpreted the results.

The primary sources of data are: the ReferenceUSA dataset (for latitude and longitude on food markets and outlets) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)â€™s website (for county-level health outcomes).

I used R and GeoDa for the statistical analysis and QGIS for geographic visualizations.
